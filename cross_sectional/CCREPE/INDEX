ccrepe                  Calculates compositionality-corrected p-values
                        and q-values for compositional data using an
                        arbitrary distance metric.
ccrepe-package          A package for analysis of sparse compositional
                        data. Allows calculation of the similarity
                        measure nc-score and calculation of
                        compositionality-corrected p-values for
                        arbitrary similarity scores (including
                        user-defined) applied to compositional data.
